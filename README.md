###PUNCHER!!! 
![](public/images/dead_mole.png)

is a game similar to a whack-a-mole game. Player have to hit as many pigs as possible with in time limit. If a pig hits the ice-cream in the center the game is over and player will not get to post his/her score.

The ERD for this project is so simple I'm not sure I even need to draw it.
Player simply waits until the time is up to see his/her score and have the option to save them by adding a three-character name. If no name is entered, the score will not be saved. So that's it, username and score in the table.

Enjoy!
