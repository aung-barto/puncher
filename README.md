is a game similar to a whack-a-mole game built by CreatJS library. Player have to hit as many pigs as possible with in time limit. If a pig hits the ice-cream in the center the game is over and player will not get to post his/her score.

The ERD for this project is so simple I'm not sure I even need to draw it.
Player simply waits until the time is up to see his/her score and have the option to save them by adding a three-character name. If no name is entered, the score will not be saved. So that's it, username and score in the table.

Characters on this site are just placeholders at the moment. I plan to redesign and update them in the future.
