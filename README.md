Puncher is a game similar to a whack-a-mole game. 

- Player has to hit as many pigs as possible with 30 seconds. 
- If a pig hits the ice-cream in the center the game is over and player will not get to post his/her score.
- Player simply waits until the time is up to see his/her score and have the option to save them by adding a three-character name. - If no name is entered, the score will not be saved.

Characters on this site are just placeholders at the moment. I plan to redesign and update them in the future.

#####Language and Frameworks:

######Javascript, Express and SQLite3
- Keeping things as basic and simple as possible since the database is very small and only for score keeping. 
- It's more front-end focused.

######CreatJS library (EaselJS, TweenJS, and SoundJS)
- CreateJS library allows me to try out different ways to interact with users.
- Sidenote: limited examples and documentation. I would try Phaser for next project.

######JQuery, HTML5, CSS3
